### Speed Test (Maximum Stable Baud Rate)
| No | Board      | RX Baud | TX Baud |
|----|------------|---------|---------|
| 1  |ESP32       | 19200   | 19200   |
| 2  |ESP8266     | 19200   | 19200   |
| 3  |Arduino Uno | 9600    | 4800    |

Baud rate lower than the listed above for specific boards are also stable. The table above only indicates the maximum stable baud rate. Most of this developments are in progress. Changes may occur anytime.
